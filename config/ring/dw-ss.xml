    <MetaDataItem name="InclusionDescription">
      Ring Contact Sensor can be added via SmartStart or via classic inclusion mode –

      SmartStart Inclusion Steps:
      1. Initiate add sensor flow in the Ring Alarm mobile application – Follow the guided add flow instructions
      provided in the application
      2. Scan the QR code found on the package of the sensor or the QR code found on the back of the sensor
      3. Pull the battery tab on the sensor
      4. When the inclusion process in complete, the LED on the sensor will be solid blue, then go out.
      5. Test the sensor. Place the magnet next to the sensor to represent a closed position (see Installation
      video to see where to
      position the magnet). If the LED flashes ONE TIME, it is successfully communicating on your Zwave network.
      If the LED on the
      sensor flashes slow and steady for 5 seconds, you need to repeat the inclusion process.

      Classic Inclusion Steps:
      1. Initiate add sensor flow in the Ring Alarm mobile application – Follow the guided add flow instructions
      provided in the application
      2. Select add manually and enter the 5 digit DSK pin found on the package of the sensor or the QR code found
      on the back of the sensor
      3. Pull the battery tab on the sensor
      4. When the inclusion process in complete, the LED on the sensor will be solid blue, then go out.
      5. Test the sensor. Place the magnet next to the sensor to represent a closed position (see Installation
      video to see where to position the magnet). If the LED flashes ONE TIME, it is successfully communicating on
      your Z-Wave network. If the LED on the
      sensor flashes slow and steady for 5 seconds, you need to repeat the inclusion process.
